# Karolina - NC News Review (14/03/2019)

## General

- Good stuff so far. A few more endpoints to make. Iâ€™d advise checking our test output below and letting that guide you before coming back to make improvements on what you have already created.
- Write your own `README.md`
- Remove any unnecessary files (e.g. `toDOOO.md`)
- Remove any comments & `console.log`s
- Make sure all linting is passing

## Testing

- Utility functions seem to have only one test each?
- Could organise `describe` blocks to give a nicer output to the terminal

- Test the default `sort` and `order` before testing the valid queries
- Queries should be separated by one `&`, not two
- It looks like you have built some things before you have tested them :(
